# odin-recipes
This project, we're building basic recipe website. The website wonâ€™t look very pretty, it's simply about trying HTML. CSS coming next.

You can find more context on why I am building this project here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes.

This project's assignment is to apply all I've learned on HTML so far.
